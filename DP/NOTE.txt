Note:
1. recursion without any dp. 
    If every node (problem) can be broken into b sub branch
         the max depth of the problem is d
    Then the time complexity is (b^d)

2. recursion with memo.
    The time complexity is really JUST number of sub problem needs to be solved
    e.g. there are M by N sub node/problem
    Then the time complexity is M*N
