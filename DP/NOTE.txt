Note:
1. recursion without any dp. 
    If every node (problem) can be broken into b sub branch
         the max depth of the problem is d
    Then the time complexity is (b^d)

2. recursion with memo.
    The time complexity is really JUST number of sub problem needs to be solved
    e.g. there are M by N sub node/problem
    Then the time complexity is M*N
    
3. 动态规划算法本质上就是穷举「状态」，然后在「选择」中选择最优解。
    明确 base case -> 明确「状态」-> 明确「选择」 -> 定义 dp 数组/函数的含义。
