Question: given list of elts = elts, given target number; find something

solution:
1. always start with dp = [sth.]*(target + 1)
2. for loop: for elt in elts: do something
3. inside the for loop
    if you CAN reuse elts, then just: 
        for number in range(elt, target+1): 
            some dp operation
    if you CANNOT reuse, then just: 
        for number in range(target, elt-1,-1) (reversed range):
            some dp opteration
