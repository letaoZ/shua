Connect Four game and rules
Connect Four (or Four-in-a-line) is a two-player 
strategy game played on a 7-column by 6-row board. 
Each player has a color and drops succesively a disc 
of his color in one column, the disc falls down to 
the lowest empty cell of the column. 

The first player to make an alignment of four discs 
of his color wins, if the board is filled without 
alignment it’s a draw game. More details on the game here.


Solving Connect Four, an history.
Connect Four is a strongly solved perfect information strategy 
game: first player has a winning strategy whatever his opponent 
plays. Initially, the game was first solved by James D. Allen 
(October 1, 1988), and independently by Victor Allis two weeks 
later (October 16, 1988). At this time, it was not yet feasible 
to brute force completely the game. Both solutions are based on
 rule based approaches in combination with knowledge database. 
 James D. Allen’s strategy1 was later published in a more complete
  book2, while Victor Allis’ solution was published in his thesis3.

Later, with more computational power, 
the game was strongly solved using brute force resolution. 
John Tromp extensively solved the game and published in 1995 
an opening database providing the outcome (win, loss, draw) of 
any 8-ply position. John Tromp’s solver4 recently solved the 
8x8 board in 2015.

The final step in solving Connect Four is to compute the best 
number of plies before the end of the game in addition to outcome 
(win, loss, draw). GameCrafters from Berkely university provided 
a first online solver5 computing the number of remaining moves to 
perform the perfect strategy. As well as Christian Kollmann’s 
solver build as student project in Graz University of Technology6.
