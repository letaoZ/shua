**494. Target Sum**

*1. Two Sum (Special case of 494)

**974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K**

NOTE: when it is about "min/max" length we need "two pointer" structure in the code; When an "ordered" nums is given or we can use "ordered" nums, we may only need two pointer structure

*560. Subarray Sum Equals K (special case of 974)

*523. Continuous Subarray Sum (special case of 974)

*713. Subarray Product Less Than K (special case of 974 + two points )

*325. Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k (special case 974 + new questions length )

*209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum (special case 974 + new questions length )

* *152. Maximum Product Subarray: this problem can be solved using DP, but it is slow.  *


*1590. Make Sum Divisible by P (special case of 974, dict) vs 974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K

1590: remove the smallest subarray s.t. sum of the remaining elts is divisible by P
>> need SMALLEST subarray
>> 

974: count num of subarrays s.t. the sum is divisible by K
>> only need a dict to record number of r where r = sum mod K
>> 


*1099. Two Sum Less Than K (special case of 974, two pointer)

*167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted (two pointer)

**628. Maximum Product of Three Numbers (just use tricks)**

**238. Product of Array Except Self**
